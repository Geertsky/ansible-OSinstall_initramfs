# Ansible Collection - geertsky.bambini

This collection was created because of the need for a new module for usage of the ansible-bambini role.

The documentation of the role can be found at [roles/ansible-bambini/README.md](roles/ansible-bambini/README.md).

The documentation of the module can be found in `ansible-doc geertsky.bambini.generate_minimal_install_urls_info`
